**Overview**

This project focuses on reducing misdiagnosis rates in psychiatric disorders using EEG (Electroencephalogram) data and machine learning models. Misdiagnosis in mental health can lead to improper treatment and poor outcomes for patients. By leveraging CatBoost and LightGBM, the goal is to compare the performance of these models in predicting psychiatric disorders and improving diagnostic accuracy, which could ultimately lead to better clinical outcomes for patients.

**Models Used:**

- **CatBoost:** A gradient boosting model designed to handle categorical features efficiently, particularly suited for handling complex datasets like EEG signals.
- **LightGBM:** A fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithms, effective for large-scale data like EEG signals.
  
**Key Objectives:**

- To determine the most accurate predictive model for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.
- To explore the impact of machine learning in reducing misdiagnosis in psychiatric contexts.
- To improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical outcomes using these models.
