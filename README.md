**Overview**

This repository focuses on reducing misdiagnosis rates in psychiatric disorders by leveraging machine learning techniques on an EEG dataset. Misdiagnosis in mental health can lead to improper treatments, worsening patient outcomes. Our research evaluates the performance of three machine learning models to identify the most accurate predictive approach for improving clinical diagnosis.

**Key Features**

- Target Problem: Misdiagnosis reduction in psychiatric disorders.
- EEG Data Utilization: Explores EEG data as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for mental health conditions.
- Machine Learning Models: Compares the effectiveness of three models: LightGBM, CatBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- Clinical Impact: Aims to improve diagnostic accuracy for better treatment and patient outcomes.

**Technologies Used**

- EEG Dataset: Dataset preprocessed for feature extraction and analysis.
- Machine Learning Models:
- LightGBM: Gradient-boosting framework optimized for speed and accuracy.
- CatBoost: Robust gradient boosting optimized for categorical data.
- Logistic Regression: Simple baseline model for benchmarking.
- Python Programming: For implementation and experimentation.
- Frameworks:
  1) scikit-learn
  2) LightGBM
  3) CatBoost
  4) Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

**Results**

- LightGBM outperformed other models in diagnostic accuracy and misdiagnosis reduction.
- CatBoost also demonstrated strong results but slightly lagged behind LightGBM.
- Logistic Regression served as a baseline and showed lower diagnostic accuracy.

**Applications**

- Clinical Diagnosis Support: Assists mental health professionals with data-driven decision-making.
- Research: Provides insights into leveraging EEG data for psychiatric disorder analysis.
- Healthcare Technology: Paves the way for more accurate and efficient diagnostic systems.

**Future Directions**

- Dataset Expansion: Include more diverse EEG datasets to improve model generalizability.
- Real-Time Deployment: Adapt models for real-time clinical applications.
- Explainability: Develop interpretable ML models to increase trust in diagnostic systems.
